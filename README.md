# Bahi — Browser-Native Accounting for Indian SMBs

> *Your books. Your file. Your browser. Nothing leaves your device.*

A browser-native, local-first accounting application for Indian SMBs. Bahi reads and writes a `.khata` file (a zip containing a SQLite double-entry ledger + manifest + attachments + in-file snapshots) on the user's own disk via the File System Access API. **No server. No account. No subscription. No telemetry.**

The app is **Bahi** (बही — the traditional bound ledger of Indian merchants). The file format it reads and writes is **`.khata`** (खाता — account/ledger), published as an open standard so any tool can implement it.

## Status — Phase 4 (goods SMB tier)

Phase 4 turns Bahi from a service-business accounting tool into a full goods business accounting tool with inventory, e-way bills, and inter-GSTIN stock transfers. On top of everything Phases 2C and 3 shipped, Phase 4 adds: **schema v7** with 11 new columns/tables, a **stock movement engine** supporting both Weighted Average Cost AND First-In-First-Out (selectable per item), opt-in **named-batch tracking** for pharma/electronics/perishables, **godowns** (single auto-seeded "Main" with multi-godown UI), automatic **stock posting hooks** on every invoice / purchase / credit note / debit note, automatic **Cost of Goods Sold journal entries** that flow into the existing Balance Sheet (Stock-in-Hand) and P&L, a full inventory module (dashboard, stock on hand, stock register, batches, valuation summary, reorder alerts, stock aging), **delivery challans** with stock movement but no GL posting, **e-way bills** with NIC bulk-upload JSON + printable PDF (with QR placeholder for the EWB number), and **inter-GSTIN stock transfers** with cross-file JSON export/import for businesses with multiple GSTINs.

### What's shipped

**Engine** (Phase 1A)
- sql.js (SQLite WASM) double-entry ledger, lazy-loaded from CDN
- `.khata` zip I/O with `manifest.json`, `books.sqlite`, `attachments/`, `exports/`, `snapshots/`
- Standard Indian Chart of Accounts seeded on file create (36 accounts)
- Posting engine with hard balance assertion (Dr = Cr or transaction rolls back)
- Append-only audit log: SHA-256 hash chain + ECDSA P-256 signatures + per-entry `origin` field
- File System Access API with **forced** read+write permission on every open
- Persistent file handles in IndexedDB
- BroadcastChannel concurrent-tab lock — one file, one tab
- Identity banner on every file open
- Clock drift sanity check
- Format version compatibility check (newer files open read-only, older migrate forward)
- Optimistic concurrency check on save with conflict modal (reload-from-disk or save-as-conflict-copy)
- Cross-origin detection on file open
- Idempotent schema migration runner with `meta.schemaVersion`

**Snapshots & recovery** (Phase 1B)
- Rolling in-file snapshot system (last 20 saves + permanent manual / FY-close)
- Snapshots panel in Debug Console with manual save + restore-as-new-file
- "Backup Now" button — dated `.khata-backup.zip` with audit-log.csv + meta.json
- Restore from backup — auto-detects `.khata` or backup zip, lists candidates, restores to a new file
- Wrong-file detection: Layer 2 (identity mismatch on workspace replace, walks `changeHistory`) and Layer 5 (fingerprinted export filenames)
- Corruption recovery modal — when `PRAGMA integrity_check` fails, lists in-file snapshots and restores to a new file
- Keypair rotation marker on cross-origin opens

**Freelancer tier** (Phase 2A)
- State stored as **ISO 3166-2:IN code** (canonical FK) with typeable input combobox
- Reference data subsystem with bundled seeds: states, GST rates, cess, TDS, TCS, RCM, composition rates, common HSN/SAC
- Customer master with GSTIN ↔ state sync
- Item / service master with HSN/SAC datalist + auto-suggested rate from history
- Invoice form with live tax computation (intra-state CGST+SGST vs inter-state IGST routing)
- Invoice posting through the double-entry engine
- Invoice list view with per-row action buttons
- P&L summary computed live from the ledger
- Indian amount-in-words helper (`Rupees X Lakh Y Thousand Only`)
- Auto invoice number per FY (`INV/26-27/0001`)
- Edit company details with per-field audit log + `manifest.company.changeHistory[]`
- Four themes (Crisp paper, Sakura wash, Asagi haze, Kinari washi) with picker in Settings

**Historical integrity** (Phase 2A.1 — `BAHI-AGENT-MSG-HISTORICAL-INTEGRITY.md`)
- Schema v2 snapshot columns: `invoices.company_snapshot`, `invoices.customer_snapshot`, `invoices.place_of_supply_name`, `invoice_lines.hsn_description`, `entry_lines.account_name`
- Posting captures snapshots from current reference data; reprint paths read snapshot columns only — no live JOINs
- All 8 invariants enforced
- 6 integrity check functions, auto-run on file open with warning toasts for legacy v1 rows

**Tax rate lifecycle** (Phase 2A.2 — `BAHI-AGENT-MSG-TAX-RATE-LIFECYCLE.md`)
- `REF.gstRates` with effective-dated records (`validFrom` / `validTo`)
- HSN seed restructured to per-code rate history
- Date-parameterized lookups: `getActiveGstRates(date)`, `getActiveHsnRate(hsnSac, date)`, `rateIdForDecimal(decimal, date)`, `getRateById(rateId)`
- Schema v3 `invoice_lines.rate_id` forensic key captured at posting time
- Both rate dropdowns (item modal + invoice line) built dynamically — **no hardcoded rate enums anywhere**
- Per-rate sub-account auto-create via `getOrCreateRateAccount`
- `postInvoiceToLedger` groups lines by rate and routes to `CGST Output @ 9%` / `IGST Output @ 18%` etc.
- `checkRateChangeResilience` integrity check
- Cess registered as separate dimension (`REF.cessRates`)

**Invoice PDF export** (Phase 2B.1 + 2B.5 Devanagari)
- jsPDF lazy CDN
- GST-compliant A4 template: TAX INVOICE title (or BILL OF SUPPLY for composition dealers), two-column header (company + invoice meta), bill-to / place-of-supply panels, lines table with multi-line description wrapping, totals + amount in words, signature block, page footer
- Reads exclusively from snapshot columns; legacy v1/v2 invoices get a peach LEGACY watermark + fall back to live joins
- Save As via FS Access with fingerprinted name (`{invoice-num}-{customer-slug}.pdf`)
- Print buttons on the invoice list (per row) and the lines modal footer
- **Devanagari**: detects Devanagari characters in any rendered text; lazy-loads Noto Sans Devanagari (~90 KB pinned-commit TTF) and switches the document font; that font also includes the ₹ rupee glyph so amounts no longer use the Helvetica "Rs." fallback

**Payments + advances** (Phase 2B.2 + 2B.6)
- Regular payment / receipt entry with multi-invoice allocation, FIFO checkboxes, bank/cash picker (with quick-add), mode + reference fields (cheque #, UTR, txn id)
- Advance receipts with back-calculated taxable from gross + GST routing, separate `advances` + `advance_adjustments` tables
- "Apply advance" section in the invoice form: open advances appear as checkboxes; on post the adjustment row is created and a reversing journal entry is automatically posted (Dr Customer Advances Received + Dr GST Output / Cr Sundry Debtors)
- Status badges (PAID / PARTIAL / DUE on invoices, OPEN / PARTIAL / FULLY ADJUSTED / REFUNDED on advances)
- Outstanding balance column on the Customers list

**Dashboard** (Phase 2B.3)
- Three KPI cards: cashflow this month vs last with delta %, total outstanding receivables, GST liability for current month
- Receivables aging table with 4 buckets (0–30 / 31–60 / 61–90 / 90+ days)
- GST liability detail panel with CGST / SGST / IGST breakdown
- Top 5 customers by outstanding amount
- Recent activity feed (last 15 audit log entries with friendly action labels: "Posted sales invoice", "Recorded receipt", "Updated company")
- Quick action buttons; auto-redirects to dashboard after file open / create / reopen

**GSTR-1 + CMP-08 export** (Phase 2B.4 + 2B.8)
- GSTR-1 monthly portal upload JSON with B2B / B2CL / B2CS / HSN / doc_issue / AT (Table 11A advances received) / TXP (Table 11B adjustments)
- CSV summary alongside the JSON for human / CA review
- Period picker (defaults to current month, supports backdated periods)
- Validation errors (missing GSTIN, missing place of supply) hard-block JSON download; CSV stays available
- Composition dealers: GSTR-1 redirects to CMP-08 quarterly view (turnover × composition rate)

**Multiple invoice series** (Phase 2B.7)
- 5 default series seeded: Domestic, Export, SEZ-WP, SEZ-WOP, Bill of Supply
- Series master CRUD; picker on the invoice form changes the auto-generated invoice number to the series's prefix
- `nextInvoiceNumber` walks invoices in the chosen series only with configured reset-on-FY behavior

**Composition scheme** (Phase 2B.8)
- `manifest.company.composition` flag with type (trader 1% / restaurant 5% / service 6%)
- Edit-company modal exposes the toggle and type picker
- When ON: invoice form hides GST routing, invoice posts without CGST/SGST/IGST, invoice PDF prints "BILL OF SUPPLY" + the mandated Rule 49 disclosure, GSTR-1 redirects to CMP-08

**Full new-company wizard** (Phase 2B.9 + 2B.10)
- Collects legal name, trade name, type (proprietorship / partnership / LLP / private / public / HUF / other), GSTIN, TAN, state (typeable combobox), address, FY start, UI tier, composition flag with type
- **PAN-aware multi-GSTIN copy**: when typing a GSTIN whose embedded PAN matches an existing workspace entry, surfaces an inline notice + Copy details button to pre-fill the legal name from the matched entry

**Company switcher** (Phase 2B.11)
- Topbar dropdown showing the current company name with a caret
- Click → menu of all workspace entries grouped by PAN with the active company highlighted
- Click an entry → save current → close → open the new file → land on dashboard

**Polish** (Phase 2C)
- **Snapshot retention**: full §9.3 policy — last 10 saves + last 7 daily + last 12 monthly + permanent (manual / FY-close), with set-union dedupe so a snapshot satisfying multiple buckets stays once
- **OPFS atomic-write staging**: every blob is mirrored to `OPFS:bahi-staging/{workspaceId}.khata` BEFORE the disk write, then cleared on success — if a save is interrupted (browser crash, OS crash, power loss, USB yank), the next file open detects the orphan staging copy with a newer audit head and surfaces a Settings → Crash recovery panel offering Recover or Discard
- **First-run welcome modal**: per-machine localStorage flag (`bahi.introSeen`), three-card explainer (Create / Open / Restore), explicit "Got it" + "Read README" buttons

**Service SMB tier** (Phase 3)
- **Schema v6**: 11 new tables (vendors, purchases, purchase_lines, credit_notes, credit_note_lines, debit_notes, debit_note_lines, tds_deductions, tcs_collections, period_locks, fy_closings) with full snapshot columns following the historical integrity invariants
- **Vendor master** mirrors customers; adds RCM-applicable flag, default TDS section, payable opening balance
- **Purchases** with internal ref (`PUR/{FY}/{NNNN}`), vendor's bill number, place-of-supply state routing, RCM toggle that auto-routes posting to GST RCM Input/Output sub-accounts, ITC eligibility flag (motor vehicles, club fees, etc. for blocked credits), per-rate GST Input sub-account auto-create, full company + vendor snapshot capture
- **Credit notes** (against invoices) and **debit notes** (against purchases) with full-reversal or partial-amount modes; both inherit the parent's company + party snapshots so reprints stay historically correct, lines proportionally allocated for partials
- **Journal voucher** form for free-form double-entry adjustments — picks any account, balance check before post
- **Reports**: Trial Balance (with debit/credit tie check), Balance Sheet (assets / liabilities / equity sections + tie check + current-period unclosed profit rollup), Day Book (chronological), Account Ledger (per-account with running balance), Sales Register, Purchase Register — all date-filterable
- **GSTR-3B** monthly summary view: Section 3.1(a) outward + 3.1(d) RCM inward + Section 4 ITC + net liability after credit, with JSON + CSV export
- **FY rollover wizard**: preview income / expense / net profit/loss for any FY, then post the year-end closing entries (zero out income/expense to P&L Summary, transfer P&L Summary to Capital Account), recorded in `fy_closings`
- **Period locks**: mark a return type (GSTR-1 / GSTR-3B / CMP-08 / GSTR-4 / 26Q / 27EQ) as filed for a date range so postings dated within get flagged as amendments
- **Tax payment challans** module: templated JSON exports for PMT-06, DRC-03, ITNS 280/281/282/283, ECR, ESI, PTRC, LWF, plus a custom challan builder
- **Sidebar restructured** into Workspace / Masters / Sales / Purchases / Money / Reports / Compliance / Dev groups (37 routes total)

**Goods SMB tier** (Phase 4)
- **Schema v7**: items get inventory columns (`enable_inventory`, `valuation_method`, `track_batches`, `reorder_level`, `preferred_vendor_id`, `opening_stock_qty`, `opening_stock_value`); 8 new tables (godowns, batches, stock_movements, delivery_challans + lines, eway_bills, stock_transfers)
- **Stock movement engine** with both **Weighted Average Cost AND First-In-First-Out**, selectable per item. WAC stores a single synthetic running-average batch per (item, godown) and recomputes the avg rate on every inward. FIFO creates one batch per inward and dequeues oldest-first on outward, splitting across batches as needed
- **Optional named-batch tracking** for pharma / electronics / perishables with mfg_date + expiry_date
- **Single auto-seeded "Main" godown**; multi-godown UI is accessible from the sidebar
- **Auto stock posting hooks** on every invoice (out), purchase (in), credit note (back in), debit note (back out), delivery challan (no GL)
- **Cost of Goods Sold journal**: every invoice also posts a separate Dr COGS / Cr Stock-in-Hand entry at the WAC or FIFO rate. Service-only items see zero behaviour change
- **Inventory dashboard** with KPIs (total stock value, items at reorder, expired batches, aged stock) + reorder alert table
- **Stock on hand** (per item × godown), **Stock movements** (full log), **Stock register** (per-item movement walkthrough with running qty), **Batches** (with expiry warnings), **Valuation summary** (drives Balance Sheet → Stock-in-Hand), **Reorder alerts** (with quick-link to create purchase from preferred vendor), **Stock aging** (0–30 / 31–60 / 61–90 / 90+ buckets)
- **Delivery challans**: outward-job / outward-sample / outward-return / inward-return; vehicle, transporter, returnable flag with expected return date; stock movement only, no GL posting
- **E-way bills**: generated from invoice or delivery challan; auto-pulls supplier + recipient + goods snapshots; transport details (transporter, vehicle, mode, distance, reason code); **NIC bulk-upload JSON export** + **printable PDF** with QR-code placeholder; "Mark as generated" workflow lets you re-export the PDF with the real EWB number after portal submission
- **Inter-GSTIN stock transfers**: outbound wizard (sender side) creates a draft transfer + raises the matching tax invoice + exports a cross-file JSON; inbound import (receiver side) loads the JSON, validates the GSTINs match, and creates a draft inbound transfer
- **Sidebar grew** from 37 → 53 routes with the Inventory group
- **Purchase form extended** with an item picker (free-text fallback for one-off services) so item-level inventory effects can be wired

## Running

Single HTML file. No build, no server-side code, no install.

```bash
cd Bahi
python3 -m http.server 8080
open http://localhost:8080/
```

**Chromium-only** (Chrome, Edge, Brave, Arc, Opera) — the File System Access API does not exist in Safari or Firefox.

The first time you open Bahi it lazy-fetches sql.js (~1 MB WASM), JSZip (~95 KB), and jsPDF (~360 KB) from jsdelivr. Subsequent loads are cached and offline.

## The `.khata` format

```
mybooks.khata  (zip)
├── manifest.json    metadata, schema version, integrity hashes, audit head, public key,
│                    company block (with changeHistory), snapshot index, mode history
├── books.sqlite     the double-entry ledger (accounts, entries, entry_lines, audit_log,
│                    customers, items, invoices, invoice_lines, meta)
├── snapshots/       rolling snapshots of previous saves (last 20 auto + permanent)
├── attachments/     user-uploaded bills, receipts, scans
└── exports/         cached report exports
```

The format is intended to outlive any single app. Reference implementation: this repo. Specification document (`khata-format.md`) will be published on naklitechie.com once the schema fully stabilises through Phase 3.

## Engineering decisions & failure model

> A confidence-building summary of the key choices made along the way, and what protects the file in adverse conditions. This section is maintained in lock-step with the build — every new phase adds the relevant guarantees here.

### Why a single file (the `.khata` zip)

The whole point of Bahi is that **your books are a single artifact you control**. One file means:
- No "where is my data?" confusion. It's the file you saved.
- Backups are `cp file.khata file-backup.khata`. No magic.
- Sync providers (Dropbox / iCloud / Drive) treat it as one unit.
- Restoration is `cp file-backup.khata file.khata`. No magic.
- The format outlives the app — anyone can `unzip file.khata` and inspect the SQLite + JSON inside.

The trade-off is that simultaneous concurrent editing across machines is genuinely hard with a single-file model. Bahi handles it via optimistic concurrency rather than pretending it can magically merge concurrent edits — see "Failure model" below.

### Why integer paise

Money is stored as `INTEGER` paise everywhere — never floats. Floats lose pennies under repeated arithmetic; tax computation does a lot of repeated arithmetic. Display is `(paise / 100).toFixed(2)` with Indian comma grouping. The audit log also hashes integer payloads so signature verification is reproducible across machines.

### Why snapshots-at-posting (Invariants 1–8 from `BAHI-AGENT-MSG-HISTORICAL-INTEGRITY.md`)

When you post an invoice, Bahi freezes the company name, customer name, GSTIN, state, HSN description, tax rate, and account names into snapshot columns on the invoice row itself. Reprints, GSTR-1 export, and any historical view read from those snapshots — never from a live JOIN on the master tables. If you rename a customer six months later, last year's invoice still prints with last year's name. This is non-negotiable for tax compliance and was a one-day refactor early on that would have been a multi-day mess after release.

### Why date-parameterized tax rates

GST rates change. We don't hardcode "18% GST" anywhere in the engine. `REF.gstRates` is a list of `(rate, validFrom, validTo)` records, and every lookup is parameterized by the invoice date. Backdated invoices automatically get the rate set that was in force then. Per-rate sub-accounts (`CGST Output @ 9%` etc.) auto-create on first use so the chart of accounts stays clean.

### Why ISO state codes (not GSTIN numeric codes)

State is stored as `ISO 3166-2:IN` (e.g. `MH`, `KA`) — the canonical FK throughout the format. The GSTIN's first two digits and the state name are derived from a lookup table at display time. This means renaming a state (Orissa → Odisha) doesn't require touching any data; it's a label change in the lookup table.

### Why an append-only audit log with a hash chain

Every meaningful action (post entry, edit company, lock period, FY close, opening stock, etc.) appends to `audit_log`. Each entry hashes `prev_hash || origin || canonicalJson(payload) || booksHash` with SHA-256, plus an ECDSA P-256 signature. The chain is never edited or rewound. The Debug Console has a verifier that walks the chain and reports any break.

This gives you three things at once:
- **Tamper evidence.** If anyone edits the SQLite directly, the books hash mismatch shows up at the next write.
- **Forensic chain-of-custody.** The `origin` field tracks where each entry was written; cross-origin opens leave a marker.
- **Crash recovery anchor.** The audit head is the comparison key for the optimistic concurrency check and the OPFS staging recovery.

### Failure model

Plain language. If you're handing this off to someone else to evaluate, this is the table to point them at.

| Scenario | Protection | What the user sees |
|---|---|---|
| Browser crash mid-save | OPFS staging mirror written before disk write | Recovery banner on dashboard + Settings → Crash recovery panel with **Recover** / **Discard** buttons |
| OS crash / power outage mid-save | Same as above | Same |
| USB drive yanked mid-save | Same as above; also, `verify-before-write` on the rebuilt blob means the disk file was never partially written | Same |
| Same browser, second tab opens the file | BroadcastChannel lock | Hard block: "This company is already open in another Bahi tab" |
| Different browser / different machine writes the file | Optimistic concurrency check at next save (re-reads disk, compares audit head) | Save conflict modal: **Reload from disk** (lose in-memory work) or **Save as conflict copy** (sibling `{slug}-conflict-{ts}.khata`) |
| File on Dropbox/iCloud syncing in background, outside change arrives | Same concurrency check fires | Same conflict modal |
| File moved to a different machine and reopened | Cross-origin detection reads the most recent audit entry's `origin`, compares to current | Informational toast; keypair rotation marker appended to the audit log so the new origin is on record |
| File on disk got corrupted | `PRAGMA integrity_check` runs on every open | Corruption recovery modal lists in-file snapshots and lets you restore one to a fresh file |
| Wrong file opened (file-name collision) | Layer 2 wrong-file detection walks `manifest.company.changeHistory` | Hard block on workspace replace if the identity doesn't match |
| Schema bumped between Bahi versions | Version-tagged migration runner in `meta.schemaVersion` | Older files migrate forward silently; newer files (above this build's `SUPPORTED_FORMAT`) open read-only with a banner |
| Audit log tampered with | SHA-256 hash chain | Chain verifier in Debug Console reports any break |

**Not protected (and probably shouldn't be):**
- **Disk hardware failure.** No software can save you. Use **Backup Now** (Settings → Snapshots) to write a dated `.khata-backup.zip` and keep one offsite.
- **Two clients writing in the exact same millisecond on a network share.** The OS filesystem decides who wins; one write may be silently dropped at the OS level. Bahi's verify-before-write keeps the file from being torn, and Layer 1 catches it on the next save attempt — but the dropped write itself is gone. Don't use Bahi as a multi-user server.
- **Sync provider conflict copies** (`Bahi (Conflicted Copy 2026-04-07).khata`). Bahi can't automatically see siblings created by Dropbox/iCloud — open them via Workspace → Open existing.
- **Reconciling two long parallel sessions.** The conflict modal saves as a conflict copy, but merging the two branches is manual. The Reconciliation View (audit-log ancestry merge) lands in Phase 6 alongside CA Mode.

### How to be extra paranoid

- Don't put a `.khata` file on a network share that two machines mount simultaneously. Pick one machine as the "owner" or move the file between machines explicitly.
- Use sync providers for backup, not concurrent editing.
- Hit **Backup Now** at the end of every session, especially before any irreversible action (FY rollover, period lock, large data import).
- Run **Debug Console → Round-trip test** after any unusual session.

The same content (in plain English) is also visible inside the app at **Settings → Safety & failure modes**, so the user can always check the contract without leaving Bahi.

## Quick test

1. Open Bahi → **Workspace** → **+ Create new .khata**
2. Enter a company name + GSTIN → state autofills → save the file to disk
3. Sidebar → **Customers** → **+ Add customer** (also typeable state input)
4. Sidebar → **Items / services** → **+ Add item** (HSN auto-suggests tax rate)
5. Sidebar → **+ New invoice** → pick the customer + add a line → Post & save
6. Sidebar → **Invoices** → click **PDF** on the row → save the GST-compliant PDF
7. Sidebar → **P&L summary** → see the income from the invoice

For low-level testing (raw posting, audit chain inspection, integrity checks, snapshot management, round-trip test): sidebar → **Debug Console** or `Ctrl+Shift+D`.

---

## Limitations and parked items

**Lower priority, on the deferred list:**
- Daily/monthly snapshot bucketing (currently last-20-saves only)
- Wrong-file detection Layer 3 (audit-log ancestry on refresh — needs Phase 6 reconciliation)
- Wrong-file detection Layer 4 (export-time identity check — there are no `.khata` exports yet)
- Audit-log replay restoration (snapshots cover the recovery use case)
- Full HSN top-2000 + SAC bundle (needs `khata-standard` repo to publish)
- Reference data update UI (Phase 2 work)
- OPFS staging for true atomic writes (currently verify-before-write)
- One-time backfill flow for legacy v1 invoices
- Devanagari / Tamil / other Indian script fonts in PDF (currently Helvetica only — uses `Rs.` instead of `₹`; Phase 2B.2 lazy-loads Noto Sans Devanagari)

**Phase 5+:** Tally import (XML parser + mapping UI) → CA mode (multi-company login) → TDS Form 26Q export + TCS Form 27EQ export + Form 27D certificates → keyboard shortcuts pass + dark mode + undo stack + landing page → launch.
